In this experiment, the source code and error message are parsed into an LLM, which classifies the root cause of the error. After that, the output text is embedded and clustered.

NOTE: Since this was only an exploratory experiment, it is not well documented and was just a prototype, which did not achieve the expected success. I still wanted to share the experiment because it could be improved into a really good approach.
