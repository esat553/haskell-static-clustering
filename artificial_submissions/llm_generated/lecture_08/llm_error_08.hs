Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falscher Argumenttyp f√ºr `head` / Incorrect Argument Type for `head`
Short Description: The expression `head x` assumes that `x` is a `String`, but `x` is actually a `Char`, since `firstChars` is a list of characters.
Intended Root Cause: Student confuses the types of elements in `firstChars` and incorrectly assumes that each element is a string rather than a character.
