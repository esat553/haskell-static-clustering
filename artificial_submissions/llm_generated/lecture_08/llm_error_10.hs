Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlanwendung der do-Notation / Misuse of do-Notation
Short Description: The `do`-notation is used in a non-monadic context to process a list, resulting in a value wrapped in a list monad rather than a plain list of tuples as expected by the function signature.
Intended Root Cause: Student misunderstands the purpose of `do`-notation and applies it outside of a proper monadic context, leading to unintended return types.
Affected Line(s): 3â€“8
