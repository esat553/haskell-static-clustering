Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Variable nicht im GÃ¼ltigkeitsbereich / Variable Not in Scope
Short Description: The helper function `go` uses the variable `n`, which is not in scope because it was not passed as a parameter.
Intended Root Cause: Student assumes that top-level parameters are implicitly available in nested helper functions without explicitly passing them.
Affected Line(s): 7
