Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlende 'where'-Klausel / Missing 'where' Clause
Short Description: Local definitions are indented as if they belong to a `where` block, but no `where` keyword is present, making the syntax invalid.
Intended Root Cause: Student assumes that indentation alone is sufficient for local definitions and forgets that a `where` keyword is required to introduce them.
Affected Line(s): 3â€“6
