Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Nicht alle FÃ¤lle abgedeckt / Incomplete Pattern Matching
Short Description: The instance definitions for `Maybe a` and `Bool` do not cover all possible constructors, which can lead to runtime errors due to non-exhaustive pattern matches.
Intended Root Cause: Student assumes that only the relevant or typical cases need to be implemented and overlooks the requirement for total pattern coverage.
Affected Line(s): 4, 7
