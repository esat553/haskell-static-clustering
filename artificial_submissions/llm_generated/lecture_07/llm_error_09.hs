Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Verwendung von Pfeilsymbolen / Incorrect Use of Arrow Symbols
Short Description: The class declaration and instance definition use `=>` and `->` incorrectlyâ€”`where` is missing in the class header, and `->` is wrongly used instead of `=>` in the instance constraint.
Intended Root Cause: Student confuses the different arrow symbols in Haskell (`->`, `=>`) and misuses them in places that require specific keywords or type class syntax.
Affected Line(s): 1, 4
