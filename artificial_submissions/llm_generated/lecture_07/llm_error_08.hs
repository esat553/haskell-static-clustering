Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Typfehler durch falsche Annahme Ã¼ber Elementtyp / Type Error Due to Incorrect Assumption About Element Type
Short Description: The expression `x + size xs` assumes that list elements are numeric (`Int`), but `x` has type `a` and no such constraint is given.
Intended Root Cause: Student incorrectly assumes that elements of the list are integers and uses arithmetic operations without restricting the type variable.
Affected Line(s): 6
