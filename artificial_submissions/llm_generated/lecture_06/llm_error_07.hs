Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Unvollst√§ndiger if-Ausdruck / Incomplete if-expression
Short Description: The `if` expression is missing a corresponding `else` branch, which is required in Haskell to form a complete conditional expression.
Intended Root Cause: Student forgets that Haskell requires both `then` and `else` branches and assumes that `if` can be used as a standalone conditional.
Affected Line(s): 6
