Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Argumentanzahl beim Funktionsaufruf / Incorrect Number of Arguments in Function Call
Short Description: The recursive call `lookupTM left` provides only one argument, but the function requires two: a key and a tree.
Intended Root Cause: Student forgets to pass the search key again during recursion and treats the helper call as if only the tree argument were needed.
