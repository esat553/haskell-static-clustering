Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Typklasse in Signatur / Incorrect Type Class in Signature
Short Description: The function uses the `<` operator, which requires an `Ord` constraint, but the type signature only specifies `Eq`.
Intended Root Cause: Student underestimates the type requirements for ordered comparisons and includes only `Eq` instead of the necessary `Ord` constraint in the type signature.
Affected Line(s): 3
