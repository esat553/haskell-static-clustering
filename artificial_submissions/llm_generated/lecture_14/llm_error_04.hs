Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlendes 'do' im else-Zweig / Missing 'do' Block in Else Branch
Short Description: Multiple actions are listed in the `else` branch of an `if` expression, but only a single expression is allowed unless explicitly grouped using `do`.
Intended Root Cause: Student assumes that indentation alone is sufficient to group multiple actions in an `if` branch, overlooking the requirement for an explicit `do` block.
Affected Line(s): 9â€“12
