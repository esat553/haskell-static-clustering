Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlendes 'do' in Sequenz von IO-Aktionen / Missing 'do' for Sequence of IO Actions
Short Description: Multiple IO actions are written sequentially without using a `do` block, which is required in Haskell to chain actions using `<-` and control flow constructs like `if`.
Intended Root Cause: Student forgets that in `main`, as in any `IO` function, a `do` block is needed to execute multiple side-effecting actions in order.
