Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehler beim Zugriff auf Record-Felder / Record Field Access Error
Short Description: The code attempts to use the record accessor function `servers` as if it were a value, instead of applying it to an instance of the record (e.g., `servers c1`).
Intended Root Cause: Student misunderstands that record field names also act as accessor functions that need to be applied to a record value, and instead treats them as if they are implicitly scoped local variables.
Affected Line(s): 11
