Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Konstruktoranwendung / Incorrect Constructor Application
Short Description: The expression `Node (x, mirror right, mirror left)` treats `Node` as a function of one 3-tuple argument, but `Node` expects three separate arguments.
Intended Root Cause: Student confuses constructor argument syntax and mistakenly groups multiple arguments into a tuple instead of passing them separately.
Affected Line(s): 11
