Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlender Pattern-Arrow in `case`-Ausdruck / Missing Pattern Arrow in `case` Expression
Short Description: The `Node x left right` pattern is not followed by a `->`, which is required to separate the pattern from the corresponding expression in a `case` block.
Intended Root Cause: Student omits the required syntax element `->` in a `case` expression and tries to write a `let` block directly after the pattern without properly starting the expression body.
Affected Line(s): 14 -16
