Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Ung√ºltiger Konstruktor im Pattern Matching / Invalid Constructor in Pattern Matching
Short Description: The pattern match `Empty` references a constructor that does not exist in the definition of `Tree`, which only has `Leaf` and `Node`.
Intended Root Cause: Student assumes that all recursive data types have an empty constructor like `Empty`, overlooking the specific constructors defined for `Tree`.
Affected Line(s): 10
