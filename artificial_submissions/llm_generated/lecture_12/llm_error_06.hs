Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falscher RÃ¼ckgabetyp / Incorrect Return Type
Short Description: The expression `(mirror right, mirror left)` returns a tuple of trees instead of a `Tree`, which does not match the expected return type of the function.
Intended Root Cause: Student misinterprets the structure of the `Tree` data type and returns a tuple instead of reconstructing the tree using the `Node` constructor.
Affected Line(s): 11
