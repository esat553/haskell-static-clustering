Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Ung√ºltiges Pattern Matching / Invalid Pattern Matching
Short Description: The pattern `Leaf x` is incorrectly written as `mirror Leaf x`, treating `Leaf` as a function rather than using pattern matching syntax. Similarly, `Node x left right` is used without parentheses, causing a parse error.
Intended Root Cause: Student confuses constructor application with pattern matching and omits necessary parentheses around multi-argument constructors in pattern position.
Affected Line(s): 10-11
