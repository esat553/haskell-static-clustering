Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Unvollst√§ndiger if-Ausdruck / Incomplete if-Expression
Short Description: The `if` expression in the `Plus` case is missing an `else` branch, which is required in Haskell to make the conditional expression complete.
Intended Root Cause: Student mistakenly assumes that an `if` expression can be used like in imperative languages without requiring an `else` branch.
Affected Line(s): after 8
