Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Arity-Fehler / Arity Mismatch
Short Description: The attribute for the 'Player' data type is missing so the value 'messi' is constructed with only four arguments instead of the required five.
Intended Root Cause: Student overlooks the required number of arguments for the data constructor and omits one during instantiation.
Error Class: Misconception (nach Korkmaz et al. 2015)
Affected Line(s): 8
