Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Fehlende abschlie√üende Anweisung im do-Block / Missing Final Statement in Do Block
Short Description: The final statement in the 'do' block is missing, so the processed output is not printed or returned.
Error Location: In the 'main' function, at the end of the 'do' block (after line 9).
Intended Root Cause: Student does not realize that every 'do' block in Haskell must end with an action (such as printing or returning a value), and omits the output statement.
Affected Line(s): End of 'main' do-block (after line 9)
