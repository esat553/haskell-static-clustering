Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Gro√ü-/Kleinschreibung im Funktionsnamen / Incorrect Capitalization in Function Name
Short Description: The method name 'Show' is capitalized instead of being written in lowercase as 'show' in the 'Show' type class instance.
Intended Root Cause: Student confuses the capitalization rules for type class names (which are capitalized) and method names (which are lowercase) in Haskell.
Error Class: Knowledge Gap (nach Korkmaz et al. 2015)
