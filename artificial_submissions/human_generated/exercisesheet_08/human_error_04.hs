Ground Truth Metadata:
Error Type: Falsche Gro√ü-/Kleinschreibung in Typdefinition / Incorrect Capitalization in Type Declaration
Short Description: The type class names 'show', 'semigroup', and 'monoid' are written in lowercase instead of the required capitalized forms 'Show', 'Semigroup', and 'Monoid'.
Intended Root Cause: Student is unaware that type class names must be capitalized in Haskell, or confuses them with method names which are usually lowercase.
Error Class: Knowledge Gap (nach Korkmaz et al. 2015)
Affected Line(s): 3, 6, 10
