## Attribution Notice for Prompt Design and Evaluation Methodology

The structure and methodology of the prompts and evaluation strategies used in this project were inspired by several recent publications on LLM-based code evaluation and automated feedback, including but not limited to:

- **Akyash et al. (2025)**, "StepGrade: Grading Programming Assignments with Context-Aware LLMs"
- **Wang et al. (2025)**, "LLM-as-a-Judge: Automating Error Analysis of Programming Assignments"
- **Hackl et al. (2023)**, "LLM-as-a-Qualitative Judge"
- **Chirkova et al. (2025)**, "Automated Error Feedback Using LLMs"
- **Dinh et al. (2024)**, "SciEX: A Benchmark for Scientific LLM Evaluations"
- **Yuan et al. (2023)**, "BatchEval: Benchmarking LLMs with Batched Evaluations"
- **Chiang et al. (2023)**, "Can LLMs Effectively Evaluate Programming Assignments?"
- **Alabdulwahab et al. (2025)**, "A Comparative Study of LLM Evaluation Strategies"

The final prompt structure and evaluation criteria were developed **independently** and tailored specifically for the context of Haskell compiler error clustering.  
Where applicable, attribution is provided in accordance with the respective license terms (e.g., CC BY 4.0).
